## The SDD is NOT a Tutorial

**What the SDD is**:
- ‚úÖ **Architecture specification** - What contracts must remain stable
- ‚úÖ **Scope definition** - What we build vs. what we don't
- ‚úÖ **Policy documentation** - Rules for fallbacks, validation, testing
- ‚úÖ **Extension guide** - How to add new models, losses, metrics
- ‚úÖ **Reference manual** - Look up specific requirements

**What the SDD is NOT**:
- ‚ùå User guide (that's GOLDEN_PATH.md)
- ‚ùå Quick start (that's README.md)
- ‚ùå Tutorial on segmentation (that's external)
- ‚ùå Decision guide (that's DECISION_GUIDES/)
- ‚ùå API documentation (that's in docstrings)

---

## Key Principle: Separation of Concerns

The SDD grew to 180 pages because we kept mixing:
1. **User instructions** ("how to train a model")
2. **Engineering contracts** ("this interface must not change")
3. **Decision guidance** ("which loss function to use")
4. **Implementation details** ("how auto-tuning works")

**Now they're separated**:

| Question | Document | Who |
|----------|----------|-----|
| How do I use this? | README.md, GOLDEN_PATH.md | Users |
| Which option should I choose? | DECISION_GUIDES/ | Users |
| What must remain stable? | CONTRACTS/ | Engineers |
| How does X work internally? | SDD.md Sections 7+ | Engineers |
| What's the full specification? | SDD.md (all) | Reviewers, Architects |

## Critical SDD Sections for Engineers

### Section 4: Architecture Contracts ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê CRITICAL
**These CANNOT change without major version bump.**

```python
# These interfaces in Section 4 are FROZEN
class DataModule(Protocol):      # Section 4.1
class Model(nn.Module):          # Section 4.2
class Loss(Protocol):            # Section 4.3
class Metrics(Protocol):         # Section 4.4
class Trainer(Protocol):         # Section 4.5
```

**Before changing any of these**:
1. Check if it breaks the contract
2. If yes ‚Üí Requires SDD v5.0 (major version)
3. If no ‚Üí Safe to implement

**Example**:
```python
# ‚ùå BREAKS CONTRACT (changes signature)
def train_dataloader(self, shuffle: bool = True) -> DataLoader:

# ‚úÖ OK (internal implementation)
def _create_train_dataset(self, augment: bool) -> Dataset:
```

### Section 4.6: Construction Factories ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê CRITICAL
**All model/checkpoint construction goes through factories.**

**Rules**:
1. **Models**: Only `src/models/factory.build_model(config)` creates models
2. **Scripts**: Never import `segmentation_models_pytorch` directly
3. **Checkpoints**: Use `src/core/checkpoints.build_checkpoint_callback()`

**Tests check this**:
- `tests/unit/test_model_factory.py` - Factory works
- `tests/unit/test_scripts_imports.py` - Scripts don't violate rules

### Section 6: Fallback Policy ‚≠ê‚≠ê IMPORTANT
**Fallbacks are for testing only, never production.**

When adding dependencies:
```python
# ‚úÖ Correct pattern
try:
    from torchmetrics import Dice
    HAVE_TORCHMETRICS = True
except ImportError:
    if should_use_fallbacks():
        from ..testing.simple_metrics import SimpleDice as Dice
        HAVE_TORCHMETRICS = False
    else:
        raise ImportError("torchmetrics required. Install: pip install torchmetrics")
```

### Section 9: Testing Strategy ‚≠ê‚≠ê IMPORTANT
**Three test tiers - know which one you're writing.**

```python
# Unit test - No ML dependencies
# tests/unit/test_config.py
def test_config_validation():
    config = {"model": {"architecture": "Unet"}}
    # Test pure logic

# Integration (minimal) - Core dependencies, fallbacks OK
# tests/integration/minimal/test_pipeline.py
@pytest.mark.minimal
def test_training_pipeline():
    # Uses simple implementations

# Integration (full) - All dependencies, no fallbacks
# tests/integration/full/test_training_full.py
@pytest.mark.full
def test_training_with_smp():
    # Uses real SMP models
```

## Common Engineering Questions

### "Can I add a new model architecture?"

**Yes**, via the factory:

1. Check if SMP supports it: https://smp.readthedocs.io/
2. If yes:
   ```python
   # src/models/factory.py
   def build_model(config):
       if architecture == "newarch":
           return smp.NewArch(...)
   ```
3. Add config schema in `src/core/config.py`
4. Add test in `tests/unit/test_model_factory.py`
5. Add to DECISION_GUIDES/choosing_architecture.md

**Don't**: Implement the architecture from scratch (violates "don't reinvent wheel")

### "Can I add a new loss function?"

**Yes**, this is an exception to "don't reinvent":

1. Loss functions are mathematical formulas (OK to implement)
2. Add to `src/losses/` following existing pattern
3. Register in `src/losses/__init__.py:get_loss()`
4. Add tests in `tests/unit/test_losses.py`
5. Document in DECISION_GUIDES/choosing_loss_function.md

**Why exception?** SMP doesn't provide losses, and these are well-defined math, not complex architectures.

### "Can I change the config schema?"

**Depends**:

```yaml
# ‚úÖ Adding new optional field - OK
model:
  architecture: "Unet"
  new_optional_param: 123  # Default to None, backward compatible

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Renaming field - Needs migration guide
model:
  classes: 1  # OLD
  out_channels: 1  # NEW - provide migration script

# ‚ùå Removing required field - Breaks compatibility
model:
  encoder: "resnet34"  # Don't remove this
```

**Process**:
1. Add new field to schema in `src/core/config.py`
2. Update `configs/base_config.yaml` with example
3. Add validation test
4. Update GOLDEN_PATH.md with new option

### "The SDD says don't do X, but I need to do X"

**Process**:
1. Check if it's actually in scope (Section 2)
2. If out of scope ‚Üí Discuss if scope should change
3. If in scope but forbidden ‚Üí Understand why (read relevant section)
4. If justified ‚Üí Propose SDD change (increment version)

**Example**:
- **In scope**: "Add new encoder from timm library" ‚Üí Allowed, use factory
- **Out of scope**: "Add object detection" ‚Üí This is segmentation only
- **Forbidden**: "Import SMP in script" ‚Üí Violates factory pattern

### "Which validation mode should my test use?"

```python
# Unit tests
os.environ['CONFIG_VALIDATION_MODE'] = 'MINIMAL'

# Integration tests (minimal)
os.environ['CONFIG_VALIDATION_MODE'] = 'MINIMAL'

# Integration tests (full)
os.environ['CONFIG_VALIDATION_MODE'] = 'STRICT'

# Production (default)
# No environment variable needed, STRICT is default
```

## Red Flags (Stop and Ask)

üö© **You're importing `segmentation_models_pytorch` in a script file**
   ‚Üí Use factory instead

üö© **You're implementing a new U-Net architecture**
   ‚Üí Use SMP's Unet, don't reinvent

üö© **You're creating `ModelCheckpoint` in multiple places**
   ‚Üí Use `checkpoints.build_checkpoint_callback()`

üö© **You're adding a fallback that will be used in production**
   ‚Üí Fallbacks are test-only

üö© **You're changing a method signature in Section 4 contracts**
   ‚Üí This breaks compatibility, needs major version bump

üö© **You're adding configuration that users must understand**
   ‚Üí Document in GOLDEN_PATH.md and DECISION_GUIDES/

## Operational Workflow (Docs + Agents)

1. **Start with the right context**: link agents or reviewers to `README_STREAMLINED.md` for user tasks, `GOLDEN_PATH.md` for end-to-end walkthroughs, and the specific decision guide that matches the issue.
2. **Log new blockers immediately**: capture reproducible steps in `docs/MANUAL_TESTS.md` before applying workarounds. Add a short note in the README "When Something Goes Wrong" table or create a new decision guide entry pointing back to the manual test.
3. **Plan new feature work**: open a note in `docs/ACTION_PLAN.md` with problem, goal, and impacted components. Reference any contracts (`CONTRACTS/`) or advanced topics (`ADVANCED/`) you expect to touch.
4. **Update policy docs before code changes**: extend `FOR_ENGINEERS.md`, `GOLDEN_PATH.md`, or the relevant decision guide with the rules your change introduces so agents have guidance before editing code.
5. **Ship with validation details**: append verification steps and expected outcomes to the same entry in `docs/MANUAL_TESTS.md` once the feature is merged; link to new documentation fragments and tests.
6. **Coordinate through PRs/issues**: call out documentation deltas in PR descriptions and point reviewers to the affected guides.

Following this loop keeps the navigation layer trustworthy and gives agents a single source for deltas before they execute changes.

## Summary: Your Mental Model

```
SDD.md = "The Constitution"
   ‚Üì
Defines what MUST remain stable (contracts)
Defines what's allowed vs forbidden (policies)
Defines how to extend (patterns)
   ‚Üì
NOT a tutorial, NOT a user guide
   ‚Üì
Read when:
- Implementing features touching core contracts
- Unsure if something is allowed
- Need to understand system architecture
- Writing tests (which tier?)
   ‚Üì
Don't read when:
- Just using the platform (read README/GOLDEN_PATH)
- Deciding which model to use (read DECISION_GUIDES)
- Writing application code (read API docs)
```

**The SDD is for builders, not users.**

## Questions?

- **"Is X in scope?"** ‚Üí SDD Section 2
- **"Can I change Y?"** ‚Üí SDD Section 4 (contracts)
- **"How should I implement Z?"** ‚Üí SDD Section 7+ (implementation guides)
- **"Why does this rule exist?"** ‚Üí Read the section, ask in discussions
- **"This seems over-engineered"** ‚Üí It might be! Propose simplification with rationale

**Remember**: The SDD grew from pain points. Every rule has a "we got burned" story behind it.
