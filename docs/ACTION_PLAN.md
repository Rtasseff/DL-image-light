# Action Plan: Streamlining the SDD

**Context**: The SDD grew from ~20 pages to 180+ pages through iterative clarifications. We need to maintain the hard-earned detail while making it usable.

**Goal**: Keep all the detail (it's there for good reasons) but organize it so readers find what they need fast.

---

## Summary of Problem

Your SDD evolution:
```
v1.0: Simple, 20 pages → Too ambiguous → Failed prototype
  ↓
v2.0: Added details → Still confusion → Engineers diverged
  ↓
v3.0: More clarifications → Redundancies found → More rules added
  ↓
v4.0: Comprehensive, 180 pages → Nobody reads it all → Back to confusion
```

**The paradox**: Detail prevents confusion, but too much detail causes confusion.

## Solution: Layered Documentation (Not Rewriting)

### Phase 1: Create Navigation Layer ✅ DONE
Files created in `docs/`:
- `README_STREAMLINED.md` - 2 pages, "Start here for users"
- `GOLDEN_PATH.md` - 15 pages, complete walkthrough
- `FOR_ENGINEERS.md` - 10 pages, "How to use the SDD"
- `SDD_HEADER_v4.1.md` - New header with routing

### Phase 2: Extract Decision Content ✅ DONE
Create `docs/DECISION_GUIDES/`:
- [x] `choosing_architecture.md`
- [x] `choosing_loss_function.md`
- [x] `choosing_encoder.md`
- [x] `debugging_memory.md`
- [x] `debugging_performance.md`
- [ ] `when_to_stop_training.md` (new)

**Source**: Extract from SDD Sections 3, 10, Appendix A  
**Time**: ~2 hours to extract and organize

### Phase 3: Extract Contracts ✅ DONE
Create `docs/CONTRACTS/`:
- [x] `stable_interfaces.md`
- [x] `configuration_schema.md`
- [x] `validation_rules.md`
- [ ] `extension_patterns.md` (consider if demand grows)

**Why**: Engineers need quick reference to "what can't change"  
**Time**: ~1 hour to extract

### Phase 4: Reorganize SDD (OPTIONAL)
Keep current SDD.md as-is, but:
- Add the new header (SDD_HEADER_v4.1.md)
- Add cross-references to new docs
- Mark sections with [USER], [ENGINEER], [ARCHITECT] tags

**Example**:
```markdown
## Section 2: Purpose & Scope [USER + ENGINEER]
For users: See simplified version in GOLDEN_PATH.md Section 1
For engineers: Full specification below...
```

### Phase 5: Update Entry Points (CRITICAL)
1. **Root README.md**: Point to `docs/README_STREAMLINED.md` ✅
2. **Contributing.md**: Point to `docs/FOR_ENGINEERS.md` (todo)
3. **Issue Templates**: Reference decision guides (todo)
4. **PR Template**: Checklist from FOR_ENGINEERS.md (todo)

## Detailed Recommendations

### What to Do With Current SDD.md

**Option A: Keep as Reference (RECOMMENDED)**
```
sdd.md → Becomes comprehensive reference
docs/SDD_HEADER_v4.1.md → Add to top
Status: "Technical Specification - See docs/ for usage guides"
```

**Pros**:
- No rewrite needed
- All detail preserved
- Clear it's not user-facing

**Cons**:
- Still intimidating
- May still get misused

**Option B: Restructure (More Work)**
```
sdd.md → Split into:
  - SDD_ARCHITECTURE.md (Sections 1-4)
  - SDD_POLICIES.md (Sections 5-9)
  - SDD_IMPLEMENTATION.md (Sections 10-15)
  - SDD_APPENDICES.md (Appendix A+)
```

**Pros**:
- More navigable
- Clearer purpose per doc

**Cons**:
- Requires reorganization
- Links may break

**Recommendation**: Start with Option A, consider Option B only if still problematic.

## Measuring Success

### User Perspective
**Before**: "This SDD is overwhelming, I'll just experiment"  
**After**: "I read the 2-page README and trained a model in 10 minutes"

**Metric**: Time from "I want to segment images" to "first training run"  
**Target**: < 15 minutes (currently probably 2+ hours)

### Engineer Perspective
**Before**: "I don't know if I can change this, better read all 180 pages"  
**After**: "FOR_ENGINEERS.md says check Section 4.2, that answers my question"

**Metric**: Time from "Can I change X?" to "Here's my implementation"  
**Target**: < 30 minutes to find relevant SDD section

### Code Quality
**Before**: Scripts import SMP, redundant checkpoints, divergent implementations  
**After**: Clean factory usage, single source of truth, aligned code

**Metric**: PR review time, test coverage, bug reports  
**Target**: Fewer architecture violations, faster reviews

## What NOT to Do

### ❌ Don't Rewrite the SDD from Scratch
- You'll lose hard-earned detail
- You'll repeat past mistakes
- Engineers have already internalized current structure

### ❌ Don't Delete "Advanced" Content
- Fallback system: Needed for testing
- Auto-tuning: Needed for edge cases
- Three-tier tests: Needed for CI

Keep it, just move it to ADVANCED/ and mark it clearly.

### ❌ Don't Try to Simplify the Architecture
- Factory pattern: Solved real problems
- Contract stability: Prevents breakage
- Validation modes: Handle different environments

The architecture is good. Just make it accessible.

### ❌ Don't Make Users Read the SDD
- Users want quick start, not specification
- Give them README → GOLDEN_PATH → Done
- Reserve SDD for builders only

## Long-Term Maintenance

### When to Update Each Document

| Document | Update When... | Frequency |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| README.md | Basic workflow changes | Rare (major versions) |
| GOLDEN_PATH.md | Config options change, common issues found | Every few months |
| DECISION_GUIDES/ | New options added, better guidance found | As needed |
| FOR_ENGINEERS.md | New patterns added, rules change | Every version |
| SDD.md | Architecture changes, policies change | Every version |
| CONTRACTS/ | Interface signatures change | Rare (major versions) |

### Preventing SDD Bloat in Future

**Before adding to SDD, ask**:
1. Is this a contract (what can't change)? → SDD Section 4
2. Is this a policy (how we handle edge cases)? → SDD Sections 5-9
3. Is this guidance (which option to choose)? → DECISION_GUIDES/
4. Is this a tutorial (how to do something)? → GOLDEN_PATH.md
5. Is this troubleshooting? → DECISION_GUIDES/debugging_*.md

**Golden Rule**: SDD is for "why" and "must", not "how" and "should"

## Your Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. Review the 4 documents I created
2. Decide if this approach works for your team
3. If yes, proceed to Week 2 tasks (extract decision guides)
4. If no, let's discuss alternative structures

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Extract remaining decision guides from SDD
2. Create CONTRACTS/ with interface specs
3. Update root README.md to point to new structure
4. Test with 1-2 users and 1-2 engineers

### Medium Term (Next Month)
1. Add cross-references throughout
2. Update contribution guidelines
3. Create PR checklist based on FOR_ENGINEERS.md
4. Archive old documentation versions

---

## Questions to Answer

### For You
1. Does this layered approach solve your problem?
2. Is 15-minute user onboarding realistic?
3. Should we extract CONTRACTS/ or keep in SDD?
4. Who will maintain decision guides going forward?

### For Your Team
1. Will engineers actually read FOR_ENGINEERS.md first?
2. Is the SDD still too long even with navigation?
3. Do users need video tutorials too?
4. Should we add a "Common Mistakes" page?

---

## Conclusion

Your SDD grew for good reasons - ambiguity caused real problems. The solution isn't to delete detail, but to **organize it by audience**:

- **Users** → README (2 pages) → GOLDEN_PATH (15 pages) → DONE
- **Engineers** → FOR_ENGINEERS (10 pages) → SDD (relevant sections) → DONE
- **Architects** → Full SDD (review/design) → DONE

**The SDD stays comprehensive. But now it has a navigation layer.**

This preserves your investment in specification while fixing the usability problem.

---

**Estimated Total Effort**: 8-12 hours over 2-3 weeks  
**Risk**: Low (no architecture changes)  
**Impact**: High (much better onboarding and clarity)

**Recommendation**: Start with Week 1 (done!) and Week 2 (extraction), then evaluate before committing to full restructure.
