# Advanced Topics Overview

Use these guides when you need capabilities beyond the Golden Path. Each page summarizes current support and the steps (or gaps) involved.

- [Installation](installation.md)
- [Deployment & Serving](deployment.md)
- [Multi-Class Segmentation](multiclass.md)
- [Cross-Validation Workflow](cross_validation.md)
- [Fallback System Reference](fallback_system.md)

If a topic is missing, open an issue with the scenario and required timeline so we can prioritize it.
